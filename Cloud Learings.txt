------------ Vm's vs Containers (e.g. Docker) -------------

VM :	
VM or virtual machine is on a high level a logical slice of a physical machine.
So for e.g. i have a machine which has 100GB of Harddisk and 10 GB of RAM, i can
create 5 slices of 20GB HD and 2 GM RAM and give logical names to them. These
slices would now work like individual machines. Each of these slices would have	their own
OS and people can login into them without even knowing if they are logical slices or
physical machines. Interesting point is each of these slices can have different OS too.
Layer Arch of VM :
	1) Hardware (RAM & HD)
	2) Host OS
	3) Hypervisor (Software used to enable Virtiaulization)
	4) Slices (or VMS)
		a) Guest OS
		b) Apps on top to Guest OS

In above Hypervisor is the software which is required and which enables virtualization or Slicing
		
Containers : 
Containization is a concept which tries to wrap an application and all its dependencies in a container
so that it could be deployed as a one unit and so it is just a lift and shift approach for applications
to be deployed anywhere. So for e.g. a Java app has dependencies of file system for configurations or
say app server like tomcat. All of these dependencies will be wrapped up in a same container, so it is like
deploy the container at any place and it would run fine as everything is deployed as a single unit.
so containers once packaged can be deployed on a physical or a VM. 
The important aspect to understand here is unlike VM's each container will not have a Guest OS installed,
so all the containers will use the underlying OS where they are deployed.
