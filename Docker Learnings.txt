------------  			Basics -----------------
Virtaualization has to be enabled for Docker to run. 
For windows, it is shown at Task Manager --> Performance --> Virtaualization

When we do docker verion, we get to see version for both client and server. So what is client and 
what is server. Server is always linux and client is Windows. Need to understand a bit more here.

Docker is a client-server architecture, so when we install docker we are installing a client-server
which communicates with the server (hub.docker.com). This communication is required for cases where
we want to pull or push images.


Web-service : If we run 2 docker containers of tomcat on port 8080, it works without any issue. How ?
			  How can 2 services run on same port ? This is because docker uses 2 different IP's for
			  launching these containers but uses the port 8080. By default Tomcat hosts on local 
				machine runs on localhost which resolves to a specific IP, but in this case as the 
				Ip's are different, it is able to launch it.
				We can use docker inspect <container_id> to check metadata respective to the container
				including the IP and port.

--------------------- 		Basics -------------------
	Each docker container has a container id and image id. What is the difference between them ? Need to check
	Each docker image needs a port to run ? Is it ? because when we run tomcat image we specify both the ports
	i.e. port of docker and port of Tomcat.
	
--------- Commands ----
To see docker installation meta-data
	docker info 
	
To see docker version
	docker version

To see all the images i have
	docker images

To pull a docker image on local
	docker pull <image_name>
	
To know which all docker containers are running
	docker container ls

To kill or stop a container
	docker kill <container_id>	
	docker stop <container_id>
	
	Both of these will stop the container,however stop will ensure
	graceful shutdown and kill will just kill the container process.
	
	
	
To run Tomcat image 
	docker run -p <tomcat_port_no>:<?> <tomcat_image_id>	
	Why do we specify 2 different ports ?
	
To find the home or installation directory of the software	
e.g. when we run a tomcat image and need to find directory where tomcat is installed, we use
	docker container exec -it <container_id> bash

	Actually exec -it is to get into the container. Container is like a tight box which does
	not interacts with the outside world. So if we need to get inside the container this command
	is used. In above example , it points us directly  to the home location of the container.
	Use command 'exit' or 'cntl-d' to come out of the Container env.
	
To copy any file on installed image path, for e.g. when we need to copy war file to Tomcat webapps folder
	docker cp '<local_file_path>' <container_id>:'<path on the container>'
	
To commit any existing container
	docker commit <container_id> '<name_of_repo>:<Tag_of_repo>'	
	
To find all events happening inside docker on the host
	docker events : This command gives all the events including stopping/starting of container and many
					other events that are associated with docker on the host.

To know stats of CPU and memory usage for a container
	docker stats <container_id>					
					
To add notes later
	docker run <image_name>	
	
	docker ps
	Seems to be similar to 'docker container ls', need to check more
	
	docker ps -all
	Seems to be showing the last command which was run.
	
	docker inspect <container_id>
	Gives meta information regarding the container for e.g. IP address etc.

------------------------ Docker File -----------------------
Docker file is named as Dockerfile and it defines metadata about the image.
i.e. 	which OS is the base of the docker file
		Which all commands are run for the docker file
		
so a docker image is assisimilation of OS, software and its dependencies.

Each command on the docker file mostly creates a new container and then joins the
previous and current image and forms a new image. Possibly it removes the temporary
image which was	created.	

Caching : Docker creates a cache of the dockerfile once run, so that if we build image 
again, it is much faster.

----------------- Docker Sub commands -------------------------------------
docker network  : 

is the one of the sub commands which provides info regarding the
network which is used in docker. Remember each container is an isolated environment and it is not
allowed to be reached by any other programs outside its domain. But this is very big contrainst.
So for e.g. we launch a webapp which needs to be called externally using a browser or any other API.
So connectivity to outside world is required. For the very same reason we have networks in Docker.
Networks are controlled via drivers and each type of driver has some characteristics.
Broadly we have 3 types of drivers (host,bridge and overlay). Details about them is described below.

Docker Network :
Basic command to list all networks :
	docker network ls
	
Drivers 
	list of networks on docker displays list of drivers.
	Drivers on a high level is the unit of network which defines scope of
	network, type of network etc.

Driver attributes:
	Scope :	
		Each driver has a Scope (i.e. local and remote)
		Local  = Local network
		Remote = 3rd Party

	Type :
		bridge 	: This is the default driver and any containers which are not specifed any drivers launch
				  with this driver.
			      This will be used when we have single host ( only 1 machine) and we want 2 of the containers
				  on this single host to be talking to each other for e.g. if we launch apache and tomcat 
				  on the given host and we want connectivity between them, we can use this.
				  A Bridge driver essentially creates a new private network which is visible only in the
				  current host. This network is given a IP range or subnet (you can inspect the network and check).
				  Each of the containers hosted on the given bridge will be allocated IP's for the given range
				  So if i launch 2 Tomcat on the bridge, both will have seperate IP's but the port could be same.
				  This private network is directly in touch with the host machine (for e.g. my windows machine).
				  
		host 	: This would be used when we have single host and we dont want containers to be talking to each
				  other.		
		overlay	: It allows to have containers on different hosts talk to each other.


-------------------------------------------
Docker image : This is another subcommand which gives imp info regarding the given image

Docker image history <image_name> : Gives all the meta-data or build info using which			
									the image was built.

Docker image inspect <image_name> : Gives useful info regarding the image.									



-------------------------------------------
Docker container : This subcommand gives specific info for the containers. 
					Please note 'Docker ps' is a short cut for 'Docker container ls'

Docker container prune :
				All the stopped container somehow stay on Docker. 'Docker ps -a'
				gives list of all container irrespective they are stopped or started.
				prune command will destroy all the stopped containers.


-----------------------------------------------
Docker system : This subcommand give info regarding the docker system. It's commands
				like events and info are already part of the shortcuts.

Docker system df :
				This provides info of the components which docker manages like images,
				containers etc.
				
				
---------------------------- Docker Compose --------------------------------------
With Docker compose, we can create a container of Containers. So we have 2 different
isolated containers wrapped up inside another container.

Use-case : 	If i have a project which is having 5 micro-services interacting with each
			other. Now i will have to remember to start all the services individually.
			So if i have to run a integ test which needs all the services to be up,
			i have a problem. For such case, we just build a parent image having 
			all the 5 child micro-services images and we can start and stop the container
			as a single unit.

Need to know more about exec -it command and what exactly it is used for.

	get the below when ran for image 'tomcat              7.0.99-jdk8-adoptopenjdk-hotspot   176fb5a50a1d'
	the input device is not a TTY.  If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'
	
	what does this mean ?
	
Need to understand more about Tomcat configurations, it has setting for adding password etc.
	
Google jib is a library which makes easy to build and deploy java apps on a container.
Need to know more.
