@SpringBootApplication : This is the main annotation which is to be used to enable a application as Spring boot.
It is a convinience annotation which would automatically enable the below.

1) @Configuration :  tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

2) @EnableAutoConfiguration :  tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, 
			    other beans, and various property settings.

3) @EnableWebMvc : Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app,
		   but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. 
		   This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors 
		   such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

@ComponentScan by default takes the current class and registers all of the below in the app on its classpath.
	@Component
		@Repository 
		@Service
 		@Controller
	@Configuration
	

Also it would try and autowire any of the beans defined by @AutoWire Annotation
Also if the basePackage can be configured using scanBasePackages attribute on the annotation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Value : This annotation can be used to inject value from application.properties. So for e.g. in below case
	 name is defined in application.properties which is used to inject into this variable.
	 This annotation also supports SPEL

	@Value("${name}")
	private String name; 

------------------------------------------- CommandLineRunner --------------------------------------------

CommandLineRunner is a functional interface which if implemented and registered would be called only once 
during SpringBoot's lifetime i.e. when the Spring boot initilization has completed. It can be used to write
a 'Application Started' log to indicate that the all the initialization has completed. In one of the examples
it was used to print all the beans initialized by the app.

------------------------------ SpringBootServletInitializer ------------------------------
SpringBootServletInitializer is an abstract class which can be used majorly when one wants to convert the spring boot instance into
a War which can be deployed to an external container.
