POM --> Project Object model

By default Maven expects 

source code in 				: src/main/java
test classes in 			: src/test/java
compiled classes in			: target/classes
compiled test classes in 	: target/test-classes

--------------------- Lifecycle, Phases, Goals, Plugins and Execution ----------------------------------------
Goals is the place where real Business logic is defined and Goals live inside plugins.
Consider Plugin as a Class and Goal as a method, so to call a given goal you will have to 
say <plugin>:<goal>, so compile goal can be called via mvn compiler:compile.

Now Lifecycle in maven is a series of steps (or phases) which are executed in an order. Phases can then be attached
to 0 or more goals.

Consider Lifecycle to be a pre-defined template to achieve a task.For e.g. for a project which is packaged as a jar
it would be first compiled, the test packs would compile, test packs would run to ensure nothing is broken, then
it would be packaged as a jar and finally the jar is placed at a set location. All of this can be achieved by running 
just a command i.e. mvn install which is a phase in the 'default' lifecycle which would call all the phases before it
and achieve the above. 

So when we hit mvn clean install, all phases in Clean lifecycle till clean and all phases in default lifecyle till
install are called in the order.

So in short we mostly call a phase in maven and maven will ensure all phases are called till that.
We can also call a specific goal if required.

There are majorly 2 lifecycles in Maven.
1) Default
2) Clean

Default Lifecycle Phases and its Plugin goals:
		It has many phases but the most important are defined as below.	
 
	1) validate	(No Plugin Goals)	:
		By default this is not tied to any plugin goals, so it would not do anything.
	
	2) compile	(compiler:compile)	:
		By default it is tied to compiler plugin's compile goal.
		In this phase, Maven will look into the source directory (i.e. src.main.java by default) 
		and compile them. If the compilation is good , classes are stored in target/classes directory by default.
	
	3) test	(surefire:test)		:
		By default it is tied to surefire plugin's test goal.
		This phase would compile the test classes defined in the directory (i.e. src.test.java by default) and
		place the compiled classes in target/test-classes directory by default. Also it would execute those cases
		and the report of the execution is placed at target/surefire-reports
	
	4) package (jar:jar)		: 
		By default it is tied to jar plugin's jar goal.
		This phase would package the project (as jar,war, pom etc) and place the package at target folder.
	
	5) verify (no Plugin Goals)		:

	6) install (install:install)		: 
		By default it is tied to install plugin's install goal.
	
		This would take the packaged jar available at target and places the jar in local repo 
		(which we generally configure in settings.xml)
	
	7) deploy (deploy:deploy)		:
		By default it is tied to deploy plugin's deploy goal.
	
		This would generally be used to take the package from local repo and publish to the central repo,
		however with build tools like TeamCity and Jenkins, not sure if it would be used.
	

Clean Lifecycle and its plugin goals

	1)	Pre-clean (No plugin goals)
	
	2) 	Clean (clean:clean)
	
	3)	Post-clean (No plugin goals)
	
	
Executions and Build plugins :	
	<build> tag in pom.xml is nothing but a build plugin. It is a way to configure a build according to your need.
	Simplest e.g. for a use case when you need to configure your build is to set a set compiler version for the
	project. In this case we will need to configure our build and add plugin or maven-compiler-plugin (compiler)
	and set a set compiler version.
	

-------------------------------- Plugin and Goals ---------------------------------------
Consider Plugin like a Class and Goal its static method. If we want to execute a goal, we will need to
refer it like compiler:compile.

So Goal has the real logic that would be executed.In above e.g. compile goal has all the logic for
compilation of the project. 


resources
	resources
	testResources

compiler
	compile
	testCompile
	
surefire
	test
	
jar
	jar
	
install
	install
	
deploy
	deploy					
	
plugin
	descriptor
	addPluginArtifactMetadata	

-------------------------- Inheritance in Maven --------------------------------
If we check in eclipse, there is a tab called Effective POM, which is a big xml which is present.
This xml is the final effective xml. In Maven each POM inherits from Super POM and what we do is
customize our needs in our POM and the combination of our POM and super POM becomes the final
Effective POM which is used in any of the phases.
 


Command to see effective POM from command line : mvn help:effective-pom


-------------------------- Repositories -------------------------
Maven (like git), has a concept of local repo and central repo. We will need to
configure both, so effectively all the dependescies of all the projects used on
current system will be available in local repo, so if any other project wants to
use the same dependency it does not go to the central maven repo.



---------------------- Dependency Management -----------------------------
Each project will have dependencies for e.g. my project uses log4j for logging,
so i would need log4j jar, and similarly i can have multiple dependencies. We can
add our dependencies in this section for the same. 

Now say i have dependency on a.jar and a.jar in its pom says it has dependecny on 
b.jar and it can go on. So on just adding a.jar, maven will help pull all the dependent
dependecis for me. So by just including 1 jar, we might end up have 5 jars in the project.
This can be also very tricky to handle because say we have 2 dependencies a.jar and b.jar
and a.jar has dependency on c-1.0.jar and b.jar is dependent on c-2.0.jar. in above case
c.jar is the single artifiact which has 2 versions and both cannot be on the project, so 
maven will decide which out of these 2 c.x jars to pick. We can also specify the same.
This dependency hierarcy can also be viewed in Eclipse.

If any of the dependencies being brought by a dependency, we dont require, we can also exclude it.


There are certain configurations in <Dependency> section which are important to know. 

Scopes of dependencies :


1) test

2) compile

3) provided

4) runtime

5) import

6) system 


------------------ Imp Commands ------------------------

To check Maven installation version : mvn --version


Compile classes : mvn compile
	This will compile everything under src/main/java

Compile test classes : mvn test-compile
	This will first compile sources and then tests under src/test/java

Cleaning maven output : mvn clean
	This will delete the target folder
	
Running tests : mvn test
	This will compile src, tests and then try to run the tests 
	and show output of test on console.

Maven with debug option (-X)
	mvn clean -X will give more output i.e. it runs in debug mode.
	
Download all source files for the dependencies
	mvn dependency:sources	
	
------------------- Maven plugins ----------------

maven-compiler-plugin : This will be used when compilation is triggered.


maven-clean-plugin : This will be used when clean is triggered.


maven-surefire-plugin : This is triggered when mvn test is executed.




------------------- Multi Module Project -----------------------------




-------------------- Maven Tomcat Plugin ---------------------------

We can run Tomcat using this plugin without having to install Tomcat. Check how ?



---------------- Need to check --------------------
Final jar does not include the test-classes. why ? 
then how will the automated junits be run on any external tool.
In video, it is shown how to change source and target version in the <build>, but it does not work.
check on it.
