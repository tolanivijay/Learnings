Javascript vs Traditional OOPs languages

In java script, there are no classes . Everything is objects . So people who may want to
reuse the same object to create a new object , do it via prototying or copying . Need to know more on this

 
In java script ,methods and properties are public , but we can still hide the data . How ?


In Javascript like java , a variable can be either a primitive or object.

Primitive types
Number
String
Boolean

Special Types
Infinity (a number too big or small which is not supported)
NAN (Not a number) : a variable as the name says which is not a number
	For e.g. var a=10 * 'f';
	In this case we are performing multiplication of number and string,hence when we ouput a on console ,
	NAN is printed.
	Incidently NAN is a type of Number in Javascript, so the below prints "Number" on the console
	typeof a;
Null : a object which is defined ,but does not have any value

Undefined : if a variable is not initialized at all , it outcomes as undefined

	
typeof : It is a operator (like instanceof in java) , which translates into either of the following

number
String
boolean
undefined
object
function


Difference between == and ===
(== is sort of a loose comparision where it converts the type before comparing.so if we
use num == str below it converts num to string internally and then does the comparision,
as against === which checks for both type and content for equality )

var str="123";
var num=123;
num == str //return true
num === str //return false


Strange things
1) If we use a boolean operator with string , it is converted to boolean

var b="abc";
var c=!b;
c;
false




	
Things to know in javascript
1) arrays, reference and scope
2) objects, classes, and prototypal inheritance
