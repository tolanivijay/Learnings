Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool, so it manages deployment of containers.
So one thing to note here is kubernetes will only manage containers and nothing else.
It is very much like Apache Storm where you can achieve HA and Horizontal scaling, difference here 
is Apache Storm will ask to implement its API's where as Kubernetes will work on any containers.
