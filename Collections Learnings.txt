------------------------------ Collection Basics ------------------------------

Type	Unordered		Ordered				Sorted
-----	----------		---------------		---------
Map		HashMap			LinkedHashMap		TreeMap
Set		HashSet			LinkedHashSet		TreeSet	





--------------------------- Lists----------------------------------------------
ArrayList : ArrayList as the name says is an Array based implementation of List which is resized on every add or remove operation.
It is based on indexes.ArrayList is typically useful when retrival is important and there are not many writes.
As on each add/remove operation , it will resize.

LinkedList : A linked list is a doubly linked list where each element knows whos behind it and
after it. It implements queue interface ,so has access to peek(),poll() and offer() methods.
Prefer LinkedList when there are many reads and writes , as it does not resize on add/remove like ArrayList




---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Removing elements while iteration : If there is any requirement to remove elements while iteration
of collection, the suitable way is to iterate collection using iterator and call iterator.remove
method. Collections.remove method called during iteration would result in ConcurrentModificationException




Queue: A queue is generally a First in First out implementation (exception is PriorityQueue which has priority order).
Apart from add() method ,it has extra methods like peek()-- fetches the head element,
poll()- which fetches the head element and removes it and offer() which adds element to the head
