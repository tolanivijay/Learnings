--------------------------------- Steps for Hibernate ---------------------------------

Create a hibernate config xml(hibernate.config.xml) which has various properties respective
to the database i.e. connection,driver,username,password etc.

Map a javabean to a table using 'Entity' annotation.
'Id' annotation defines which is the primary key on the table.

Create a session factory (Need to create only one session factory as it is resource intensive)
Create a session out of this session factory.
Use save on the object to insert record in db.
