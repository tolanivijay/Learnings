-------------------- Categories of Estimation Techniques -----------------------------
1) Analogous or Top/Bottom approach : This approach is used when we have very high level
	information regarding a project, so it is more of a guess-estimates.
	For e.g. we say it will take around 3-5 weeks for the project to complete 
	
2) Parametric approach : Here we rely on historic data to map current work and come up
	with estimates. For e.g. a relatively similar project with same resources
	was done in x days, and the current work is around double the work , so the
	estimates would be 2x.
	
3) Micro or bottom top approach : This approach provides better estimates,but the
	pre-requisites for this approach is stable requirement. Once we have
	stable requirements, we would then try and break down that work into
	smaller measurable chunks and then put down estimates for these chunks,
	which would then give better estimates.
