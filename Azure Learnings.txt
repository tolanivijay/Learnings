--------------------   Azure Compute Options ------------------

Computing is on high level where to get an app deployed in Azure. Azure provides us 4 compute options as below

1) VM's
2) Containers
3) server-less computing (e.g. functions)
	Server-less on a high level means define your functionality and submit it to Azure and it will take care 
	where these needs to be deployed and other similar aspects. So we dont need to containerize them or
	deploy them on VMs, we just define the functionality (via functions) and not worry anything more.
	Functions are typically end-points of events, say trigger an email(function) if the order is placed.
4) Azure App Service
	Typically for mission critical apps which are performance oriented, Azure provides this option where
	it would scale apps for us and we have to focus only to provide Business logic.

	
----------------- Azure Data Storage Options ----------------------
It seems Azure has very limited options w.r.t data storage and it supports MSSQL and Cosmos DB (NoSQL DB like MongoDB).
However need to explore more if required.


------------------ Azure Disk Storage Options ---------------------------------

1) Virtual or Unmanaged disks	: 
2) Managed disks 				: They have better availability than virtual disks.

--------------------- VM's in Azure --------------------------
All Vm's in Azure have at-least 2 disks associated with it.
	1) OS Disk
	2) Temp Disk : Data here will get lost when the VM is shutdown.



------------------ Accessing Azure ------------------
Need to explore these methods.
	Azure portal
	Azure PowerShell
	Azure CLI
	Azure SDKs (like .NET, Java)

--------------------- Azure Basics -----------------------

Resource Groups : 
Any resources in Azure (i.e. VM's,Web apps etc), need to be part of Resource Groups.
It is just a way to bucket resources together.


App Service Plan (ASP) :
In Azure, cost is determined by the usage of the apps in terms of CPU, RAM etc.
For e.g. if i say i need 2 CPU cores and 2 GM of RAM, and my services should run in 
West india, an ASP is prepared and i can assign services to the given ASP. I can assign
n number of services to this given ASP. So on a high level it is a meta of billing. Below are the factors
for an ASP

	Region (West US, East US, etc.)
	Number of VM instances
	Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)
	Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, Isolated)
	
	
------------------- Azure Resources -------------------------
App Services (or Web app) :

This can be thought of an Website end-point which is exposed over the web, so for e.g.
if we want a restful endpoint being exposed over the web, we simply create a App Service 
and it is then exposed over the web.

An important aspect here is these services may not be hosted on a VM, we can just create a
service and Azure will host it on any VM and we dont even know where the service is hosted.

Logging of these services :
As we saw a service can be deployed anywhere, so how do we access logs for the same.
Logs can be enabled under Monioring --> 'App Service Logs', and these logs are then 
shown as a stream on the UI with Monitoring --> 'Log Stream'.

Also a very important aspect which Azure exposes is Kudu Console. This is found under
Development Tools --> 'Advanced Tools'. It has lots of features and one of it is going to
the Logs directly from browser via SSH or Bash or even Stream the logs as we saw above.


----------------------- Template based products for IAC (Infra as Code) -----------------------
These are all supported on Azure and help in maintaining Infra as a code i.e. can maintain Infrastructure
in scripts which can then be used to deploy the whole infrastructure via scripts.

1) Terraform
2) ARM
3) Ansible 
4) Jenkins
5) Puppet (UBS Deploy)


---------------------------------- Containers ---------------------------------------------
Azure Container Registry (ACR) 	: This is like storing my own images on Azure.
Azure Container Instance 		: It is a way to create my own Container Instance. 
								  Need to check how to launch a image from ACS.
Web app for Containers 			: This is the way to create webapps for Containers								  
								  (i.e. Spring boot or Tomcat ones)



------------------- Things to check -------------------------------------------------------
Azure :
	Need to check how logs are updated and if we can check logs via SSH to host-name etc.


Kudu : What is Kudu and what does it provide.
Azul Zulu : It provides JDK, Need to understand more.
