Amdocs written test:
1) Write a program for ATM notes retrival system which takes of below
   a) It always ensures the least number of notes disbursed based on amount
   b) Handle concurrency
   c) It sends information regarding the denomiation and no of notes(for e.g 500*1+100*2 = 700)
   
2) What is the use of version in Hibernate/JPA. Give example
3) Given a connectionPool class ,extend the class to give info if there is any connectionLeak
4) static method of collection which takes a Collection and returns a SyncCollection.How would u implement
   such a thing ?

1) How to avoid data race without locking ?
2) How to programatically detect deadlock ?
3) What is optimistic and passimistic locking ?
4) Considering a Map of String vs Integer,where Integer is updated a good number of times,
   how would u design to fetch best performance.

Numora (Round 1)

1) Considering there can be n number of multiple requests on a servlet, will this not cause an issue ?
    for e.g. 100000 simultaneous requests can cause issues,how can we control it ?
2) 



(Round 2)
1) On a 32 bit JVM, how will you deal with OutofMemoryError.
   i.e. if you face OfMError, what we do about it ? How much RAM would you increase ?
   have you ever seen GC Logs to check memory ?
2) Questions around immutable class.
3) If a response is around 500 MB, how would u design an application if there are 
   10 simultaneous requests on the same node.
   We need to even consider all 10 requests should not suffer time lag.Once again
   consider 32 bit JVM.
4) What do you prefer is a better response structure xml or json? 
5) Explan Java GC
5)

Written Problems:
1) 	Write a program for connection pool, where initially we would have 10 connections, it should have
	API for fetch and release connection where the fetch should wait for 1 min or else return if the
	pool is occupied.
	
2)	Write a batch process which does the below
			Connects to database and fetches search strings and search folders 
			Searches all the files present in the list of folders for all the strings supplied.
			The process has to be multi-threaded i.e. it should start with 5 threads, each searching on
			seperate files.

3)	Implement a trade store which receives loads of files from upstream and store them in the given format

	Trade Id	Trade version	Cntr Party Id		Book Id			Trade date		

		Some validations and enrichments.
		
4) 	Write a program which will create deadlock.
	Implment a program with Optimistic lock and handle case when the optimistic condition is not correct.


Ist Round
	Implement a ArrayList
	When objects are passed, is it passed by value or pass by reference.
	Write a program which has 2 threads each printing even and odd numbers but the sequence of print should be
	correct i.e. 1,2,3,4,5........
	2nd highest marks.
	Difference between a primary and unique key.
	

2nd Round

First Round
	Given a file of 10 GB, how do you read, process and perform operations on the file, condition is
	we have a single JVM with 128 MB of RAM.
	Having a big xml, how do you process it once again on a single JVM of 128 MB of RAM.

	Which transaction manager was used in @Transactional ?

	How in a query do you get both minmum and maximum salary in the same query.
	What is timeToLive and flushToDisk properties in ehcache.

	If parent class is not searalized and child class is, what happens about properties from parent class
	Are they transferred ?
	How about static properties of a class during serailization ?
	What is global server load balancing vs local server load balancing.
	If a service has DAO, how can i dynamically pass DAO to the service layer, so that i get user specific
	DAO each time.
	For e.g., i have 5 users and i prepare 5 Datasource w.r.t each user, now depending upon the user making
	the request, respective DAO is used in the service layer.
	If we have a slow service or a service which is down which is dependency on my exposed service,how
	can i design an app considering i have lot of hits on my given service.
