Shell : Shell is nothing but an program which allows to start other programs.
	For e.g. command prompt on DOS. Windows explorer on Windows and 
	shell prompt on unix.
	
chmod +x <script_name> makes a script executable.

------------------------ Scripting basics ------------------------

.. '>' is used to redirect the output of any command onto a file.
    for e.g. less <file_name> > <new file_name>.
    This command copies all the contents of the current file to a new file.
    
    Any command that we run can have errors ,if we have to list down the errors out of 
    a script,we can use >2 for e.g. in below case all results are written to results file
    and errors are written to errors file.
    
    find -name abc.txt > results >2 errors
    
.. '>>' is used to redirect output of any command to end of an existing file.


.. '|' is used to conjuncate two commands, the first which is producing a result
   and second which is expecting any input, so the results of first command are
   redirected as input to the second command.
   
.. '&' is used to perform a given task asyncronously. for e.g. sleep 100 makes a program
	sleep for 100 secs,if i do sleep &, it spawns a new process and perfoms the task
	in that process,and the next command in the script executes instantly.
