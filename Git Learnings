Git is a Distributed Version control which is different than Central Version Control systems like SVN and Perforce.

Central Version Control :
	Here most of the operations are dependent on the server, so if you have to commit, see history etc,
	all of these operations are done on the server, where the client has just the snapshot of the server.
	
	
Distributes Version Control :
	Here we have concept of local repo and remote repo and local repo is like a mirror image of remote server
	at a given point of time. It not just has the code but a complete history of changes available at
	client side. Only when we have to push the changes across to the server, we need to go online.
	All commits can be done to local repo and then we can push all these commits at any given point of time
	to the server.
	
Git is LightWeight :
	Logically Git is based on concept of repo and a repo can have n number of branches. Now when we clone
	the repo, we get branches and history of all the branches in repo, so it has to be consuming lot of 
	disk space right ? Actually no, Git uses compression very well , so even though it stores lot of matter
	it is surprisingly very lightWeight.
	

Git Vs GitHub
Git necessarily means repo on local and GitHub is the central Repo.



Gitignore : what is it ?



-------------------------------------- Git Commands ------------------------------------------
git init : git init will create a local repo. Possibly this is used to create a new repo ?
