JPA stands for Java Persistance API and is a specification for Persistance majorly ORM's like hibernate.
Hibernate is an implementation of JPA.

Spring Data JPA adds one more layer here and makes development really easy when talking to Database is concerned.
We can configure which JPA implementation to chose but by default it uses hibernate.

Using JPA one may not even realize that it is hibernate behind the hoods.

Spring data JPA dependency in spring boot also provides springJDBC classes like jdbcTemplate, so we can Spring JDBC too
if required.
