Issue : Even after implementing MongoRepository and registering it as a dependency in the service layer, somehow
	this bean was not initialized and would fail while startup as the app was not able to autowire it in
	service layer.
Fix :	@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackageClasses=EmpRepository.class)
