Connectivity to MongoDB can be achieved using 2 ways.
	1) Use mongodb-driver jar without using any framework.
	2) Use Spring data mongo, which is wrapper above mongo driver and is very convenient to use.


------------------------- Spring Data Mongo ----------------------------------
There are broadly 2 ways in which connectivity to mongo can be established using spring data

	1) Using MongoRepository
	2) Using MongoTemplate

Though MongoRepository seems to be a very simple solution it is generally not recommended over using MongoTemplate.
Why ? Need to check.

	MongoTemplate: Below are the high level classes which needs to be understood.
		MongoClient and MongoClientOptions : Both of these classes are coming from Mongo Driver and broadly would abstract
							Mongo connection options like URL,port, time to live etc.

		MongoOperations and MongoTemplate : MongoOperations is an interface and MongoTemplate is an implementation. It would
							broadly have methods which can be used to read and write to MongoDB. It will have 
							most of the implementations that is required, however if one needs to go at the 
							driver level, we can do so using execute method of MongoTemplate which would				
							expose the driver API's.
		MongoDBFactory			: It is just a wrapper class over MongoClient and would majorly abstract dbName.



MongoTemplate is a thread-safe class and can be used across multiple instances.	


WriteConcern : How to identify if a write is succesful ? It is just write to Primary node, Primary + all Secondary or any other combination.
		Write concern is the policy which defines the same.

ReadConcern:

a sample program connecting to mongo without using spring data.
Why is MongoRepository not recommended ? is it treadsafe.
