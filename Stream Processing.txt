What is a Stream ?
Stream is like a continuous data pipeline where messages are posted continuosly, so we can consider a Stream to be
like a MQ where number of messages are posted per sec or minute.

Stream Processing :
If the data is flowing continously, we also need a took/framework which can process those messages in realtime.
Here as the messages are continously flowing, so our framework should also support and process these messages
in realtime, else the number of messages will become too much for any system.
