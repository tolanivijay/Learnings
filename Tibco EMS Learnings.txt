TIBCO EMS (Enterprise Messaging server) is the heart of the communication channel.
All producers send message to this server and all subsribers are sent messages from this server.
So it can be said to be a central point of communication for all message producers and subscibers.
All queues or Topics are hosted on this EMS server.

--------------------- Message delivery Modes ---------------------

JMS specification specifies 2 delievery modes
1) Persistent
2) Non-Persistent
3) Reliable

Only Peristent messages are persisted,not the other 2 types.



---------------------------------- Topics -----------------------------------

Topics are objects just like a queue which are used in pub-sub mechanism,where a single
message needs to be delievered to more than one subcribers.

Durable and non-durable subscribers(or message consumers).
	Subsribers can be registered as durable or non-durable. When durable subsciber
	is created it is like a subsciber which is registered with EMS for the topic as 
	'Get all messages on the Topic always'. This means it is guranted that all messages
	written on that Topic are guranted to be received by the subsciber irrespective
	that the subsciber is online or not at the time of message send. So for e.g.
	if 2 messages are delievered on a Topic when a durable subcriber was down,
	these messages are stored on the Topic till the time this subsciber comes back up
	and consumes this message.
	
	Non-Durable : On the contrary if a subsciber is registered as non-durable and messages
	are sent when it is offline, the messages are not delievered to this subcriber.
	A new subscription is created when it is comes back online and only messages created
	later make it to the subcriber.
	
----------------------------- 	Persistent message store mechanism ----------------------------------------

The EMS server has 2 options for Persistent message stores on the disk.
	1) Async : This is the default option and messages are persisted asyncronously i.e. the
			Producer is not blocked till the time the message is persisted. So if a persist fails,producer does not
			know about it
	2) Sync : In this case, producer is blocked till the message is persisted by the EMS server.		
	
----------------------------------- Bridges ----------------------------------------------------

Bridges are used when the same message needs to be sent to more than object. For e.g. if the same message
needs to be sent to my consumers and also to an app for Data warehousing or a different Topics based on
message headers.

We can bridges between any objects i.e. between Queue and Topic or Topic and Queue or any other combo.
So for e.g. i have a bridge from a Topic to queue , so all messages on this topic or landed in the respective
queue as well, so i want a subset of messages to be sent to other Topics say for e.g. based on header 'urgency',
so i can have a message selector on bridge with query and only those messages are sent to this Topic.

Please Note here that Bridges can be setup only for objects on the same EMS server. For communication 
between one or many EMS server,use routes

----------------------------------- Routes ----------------------------------------------------

Routes are used, when we need communication between objects (Topics or queues) on different EMS server.
