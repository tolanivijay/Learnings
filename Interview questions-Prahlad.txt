Problem Solving
We have multiple data-sources having millions of records.How would we process this amount of records.
Given a theatre (i.e a matrix of x * y) , find all available 3 consecutive seats




Collections

What is fail fast and fail safe ?
	ArrayList is fail fast, vector,concurrentHashMap is fail safe.
Internal workings of HashMap and HashSet.
How linkedList will maintain insertion order.

What is LinkedHashMap and what is it used for.

TreeMap will throw ClassCastException if the object does not implement Comparable.

Nullability and collections.
	
	
MultiTreading
What is holdlock() method --> It is a method of Thread class which tells if the current thread holds lock of specified object
				
	Executor framework
		What is a future object. Submit of Executor service returns future object, why ?
		What is shutdown command in executer service and why is it preferred ?

	Immutable objects
		What to create immutable objects,what are benefits?
			They are thread safe.
			Objects have to be immutable if used as a key on HashMap etc.
			
		Why is string immutable
			Because String is very common to define names for connection etc and cause lot of issues if they change.
			String recide in common area and are shared, if changed it can cause lot of issues.

What is fork-join framework ? usage of it.
	Based on work-stealing algorithm.
	
Difference between concurrency & parallelism.
	Running more than one task is called concurrency
	Spliting a task into smaller units and running all of them in parallel is called parallelism.
Infinitely running thread can be stopped by interrupt(). 
We have to call this method from different thread on the interrupting thread object.

What is ThreadLocal ?

Try an example for FutureTask.
What is cyclic barrier and usage.
What is atomic
			
Serialization
What is serialversionID ?
If we do not provide serialversionID and if we make any changes in the class  before deserialization 
Then exception is thrown by java on runtime... invalidclassexception . 

Design patterns
What is Factory & Abstract Factory and what is the difference between them.
When would you use singelton ? use cases for the same
	Logging --> While logging, we cannot create more than 1 logging object as multiple areas would use logging and 
			would un-necessary clough heap area.
	Any getInstance() case.		


Memory Management, JVM and GC
Which command helps to control stack size for JVM -Xss
What does stack (local variables,method calls,static variables )and heap contain(all objects)
What is perm-gen and what does it contain ?
Perm-gen is not available in Java 8 anymore.
Types of GC's
Memory areas are :
1) method
2)heap
3)stack
4)PC register 
5) native method area




Class Loaders
Different types of class loaders ?
All delegates request first to parents class loaders.
Classes load by child class loaders have visibility in the claaes load by parents.
Visual VM is most popular way of generating a thread dump in multi thread application. 
it helps you to analysis thread performance,cpu consumption by thread and thread states etc..
Difference between NoclassdefFoundError and Classnotfoundexception
	NoclassdefFoundError comes when the class was available at compile but not able to load at runtime.
	Classnotfoundexception comes when classloader tries to load the class explicitly on runtime.


Compiler
Jit compiler is used for to execute repeatedly executed methods...profiler identity the hotspot means which method to execute.


Clonning
clone method of object is a native method, what is native ?
What is shallow and deep copy, examples of the same.
Constructor is not called while clonning.


Spring
What is BeanFactory & ApplicationContext. What is the difference between these 2.
	Mostly they are same.application context provides few more features like 
	internationalization,text message support,event to beans that are registered as listeners.
	Bean Factory has lazy loading and ApplicationContext has eager loading
	
What are interceptors and what are they used for ?
	For cross cutting concerns like logging.
	
How to write init method and destroy method on a given bean in Spring.

Spring beans and thread safety ?
Cyclic Dependency and spring.

Design-Patterns & Principles
SOLID :

1) Single responsibility principal 
2)open closed design principal 
3) Liskov substitution principal 
4) Interface segregation principal 
5) dependency inversion principal 


DB
Clustered Index and non-clustered index.
Remove Duplicates using row_num.
nth highest marks.


Others

What is JPA for ?
Substring API change between Java 6 and 7.
Java 7 features.
5 different ways to create an object :
1) using new keyword
2) using newinstance method of class
3) using newinstance method of construtor
4)using serialization
5) using clone method
