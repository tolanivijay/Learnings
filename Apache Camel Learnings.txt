----------------------------------------- Imp Abstractions to Remember ------------------------------

Component And EndPoint : An Endpoint means a location from which a message can be consumed or written.
For e.g. Consume from 'x' file location and copy it to 'y' MQ.

Here x and y are endpoints where x is of type File and y is of type MQ.

Type in above refers to Component so x corresponds to FileComponent and y corresponds to JMSComponent.
so file endpoint will be something like file:<file_location>?<options> 
jms endpoint will be something like jms://<queue_name>


Producer and Consumer : A producer as the name suggests is an Entity capable of writing a message to
a given endpoint.

Consumer means an entity capable to consume from an Endpoint.Consumer consumes from endpoint prepares
a message and exchange which is then routed according to route definition.

There are broadly 2 consumer types avilable
1) Event Driven
2) Polling Consumer


------------------------------------------ Imp classes in Camel --------------------------------------

*) Message : This is the main message which is transported through out the routes

Message contains the following

1) Headers : Any key value pairs required for the message
2) Payload or body : This is the main body
3) Attachment : Optional attachment <Need to explore more>


*) Exchange : This can be said as the message's container which encapsulates Message + some other important objects

ExchangeId : A unique indentifier for this exchange.

Message Exchange Pattern(MEP): It denotes whether the exchange is InOnly or InOut.

InOnly 	: This is used when it is a single direction route (for which no response is expected)
InOut	: This is used when it is a traditional request-response case 
	  When InOut, Exchange has a Out object as well.
	  
Exception : If any exception during routing,this is populated.

Properties :Similar to Header of message. This should be used to store global-properties(Will add more)

In Message : Mandatory In message.

Out Message : Populated only if MEP = 'InOut'
