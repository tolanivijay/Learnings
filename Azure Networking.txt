Public IP vs Private IP
	Public IP is any IP which is internet facing for e.g. if we ping google.co.in we get an IP back
	and if we just put the IP in chrome, google.com page comes back. Any service exposed on internet has to have
	a public IP.
	
	Private IP is the one which is not exposed in public, but is only visible in the given private network, like
	corporate VM's etc.
	
IPV4 :
	This is a way to identify an IP, which means IP is divided in 4 buckets, having 8 bits each, so a possibility 
	of 2 raised to 8 combinations in each bucket, so in all 256.
	
	<0-255>.<0-255>.<0-255>.<0-255>, so any IP can be from the given combination.	
	
Virtual Network(VNet) on Azure
	A VNet is visible only on a subscription and in a given region.So my Vnet cannot cross region boundaries.
	Each VNET is assigned a range of IP's which it can use.
	
	Subnets are then the sub-division of network, so for e.g. VNet had 100 Ip's available, we can divide this 
	in 3 Subnets with 30,40 and 40 Ip's respectively.
	
	Subnetting and CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing) :
		Subnetting as we know is a way to divide an existing VNet in multiple subnetworks.One of the ways 
		how subnetting is done is CIDR. for e.g.
		
		200.200.200.200/24 is an example of CIDR range which means first 24 bits are constant, so a subnetwork can
		use any IP between 200.200.200.0 to 200.200.200.255 
	
	Resousces like VM's sit on any given subnet on a Vnet. This VM's can sit on any datacentre (or availability zone)
	inside the region.
	
Network Interface Card (NIC)
	NIC's normally help in communication with various resources, say for e.g. 2 VM's in a given subnet want to talk 
	to each other, they can talk with the help of a NIC. Both these VMS are connected to a common NIC
	and then the comminication is established. This NIC can have a private IP in this case which is used by VM to 
	establish the connection.
	NIC can be connected to NSG to setup firewall rules.  	


NSG (Network Security Group) :
	This can be thought of as a firewall which has rules which
	all outbound and inbound traffic is allowed.
		

Region & Avaliability zone :
	Avaliability zones are data-centeres supported in a given region.
