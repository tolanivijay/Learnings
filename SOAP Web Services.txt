Web-Service: As the name suggests, any service that is hosted over web is termed as Web-service.
Advantages of Web-services is that it exposes a functionality over a network which could be called
by any platform irrespective of the language it was writtern and the consumer understands that language.
So any .net or any other application can call a web-service written in java.

SOAP (Simple Object Access protocol) is a more traditional type of Webservice and is also pretty much
complicated and heavy as compared to REST types.Below are the few things which needs to be understand for
using SOAP based services.

WSDL(Web Service Definition Language): As the name suggests it defines the contract for the web-service.
So in general, what are the various parameters the service takes and what output is returned out of the
service is defined over there.

UDDI (Univeral Description Discovery and Integration): It is like yellow pages for Web-service.
Any consumer who wants to find a Web-service needs to access UDDI , from which it gets to find a 
Web-service. (Need to understand more here)

SOAP: SOAP is a xml format message which is used as the input to the web-service.So a client
creates a SOAP message which has details of what input it is providing and this SOAP message is 
then sent out to the actual Web-service as an entry point. We need SOAP as communication channel
as it is xml format and hence platform independent considering all languages pretty much understand
xmls.
