SSO - Single Sign on.
SSO is a mechanism where you have to sign in just once to access a host of applications where are provided.
For e.g. if we login to google, then we dont need to login again to GMail,GDrive or any other google apps.

------------------------------- Mechanism and Party's ----------------------
Service Provider (SP) : 
A SP is the party who is offering services for customers , so if i launch a website for users
i am a SP.

Identity Provider (IDP):
IDP's sole purpose is to provide identity services, so that we can have secure access to site's or API's.
so all customers or users for SP will have to register with the IDP and SP will redirect requests to IDP all the time.


What happens when i try to access a SP.
*) 	Whenever i try to access SP, requests are fwded to IDP, so in this case it is a first request so IDP will 
	ask the user to provide authentication which can user-name/password or services like google where it generates
	a token on the user mobile. On successful authentication, it generates a secure token which the browser possibly
	caches (like cookies) and redirects the request to the SP. Also this secure token can have important information
	for a user like authrizations etc, which the IDP can extract and show only elligible content to this user.
*)	On any subsequent requests, the flow remains same i.e. it is sent to SP via IDP, but the difference is IDP will
	not generate a new token but just validate the token generated from first request and rest everything is same.
*)	If i offer multiple apps, i can authenticate the user via the same token each time (like google does for GMail.Youtube etc)			


OKTA is a popular IDP.
