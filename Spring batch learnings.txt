---------------------------------------- Things to check -----------------------------------
When added dependency of spring batch in pom, the application failed to start with error
Failed to auto-configure a DataSource: 'spring.datasource.url'.

It seems it needs some data-source configuration to start with. Should not be the case otherwise
it would not support case of reading from file system and writing to a file system
